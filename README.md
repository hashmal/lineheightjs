LineheightJS
============

Creating web-page layouts with a constant line-height is difficult.
LineheightJS adds horizontal stripes on any HTML document, enabling you to
visualize where your elements get misaligned.

Usage
-----

Create a bookmark pointing to the following address:

    javascript:!document.lineheightjs?document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("script")).src="http://www.bravebolt.com/lineheightjs/lineheight.js":document.lineheightjs.toggle();void(0)

Clicking on it toggles the display of LineheightJS on (almost) any page.

Dependencies
------------

LineheightJS uses [PNGlib](http://www.xarg.org/2010/03/generate-client-side-png-files-using-javascript/)
to generate the overlay image.
